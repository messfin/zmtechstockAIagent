## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### **For Traders**

1. **Check the Trend:** Look at the **EMA Ribbons**. If EMA 20 > EMA 50 > EMA 200, it's a strong uptrend.
2. **Confirm Signals:** Don't rely on just one indicator. Look for a **Buy Signal** arrow AND **RSI** crossing above 30.
3. **Use Heikin-Ashi:** Switch chart type to **Heikin-Ashi** to filter out noise and see the true trend clearly.

### **For Investors**

1. **Read the Thesis:** The AI explains the _business case_. Is the company growing? Are margins improving?
2. **Check Risks:** Always read the **Risk Factors** section. What could go wrong?
3. **Price Targets:** Use the AI's **Price Target** and **Timeframe** to set realistic expectations.

### **Using the Forecast**

- Enable **SARIMA Forecast** in the sidebar.
- The **Yellow Dashed Line** shows the predicted path.
- **Note:** This is a statistical projection, not a guarantee. Use it to gauge potential direction.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**"Ticker not found"**

- Check the spelling (e.g., `GOOGL` vs `GOOGLE`).
- Some foreign stocks need a suffix (e.g., `TCS.NS` for NSE).

**"Chart looks empty"**

- Try increasing the **Date Range** (e.g., from 1mo to 1y).
- Some new IPOs may not have enough data for all indicators (like EMA 200).
